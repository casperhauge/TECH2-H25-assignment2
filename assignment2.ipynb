    "In this assignment, you are asked to analyze a 10% sub-sample of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a survey of household portfolios that is representative of the US population. The survey was administered every 3 years from 1989 to 2022. The appendix in this document contains a description of the variables present in this data set (this is a subset; the original SCF contains many more variables).\n",

    "    1.  Read the CSV file `SCF_10pct.csv` stored in this repository.\n",
    "    2.  Keep only observations where the household head is aged between 25 and 89. \n",
    "    3.  Create the column `'college'`, which contains an indicator variable that is 1 when the household head has at least some college (column `'educ'` is 3 or 4), and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "    4.  Divide the values in the column `'networth'` by 1,000 so that they are reported in thousands of US dollars.\n",
    "    5.  Report the number of observations in the final sample.\n",

# How I used AI (statement):
# I used ChatGPT (IDEAS) to draft this single, loop-based pandas/matplotlib solution
# following the assignment constraints (no groupby, clear plots with labels/titles/legend).
# I reviewed the code and verified it runs end-to-end in the TECH2 environment.
